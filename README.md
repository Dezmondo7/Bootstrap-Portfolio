# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## The aim of the project was to build a version of my portfolio built in HTML and CSS with the use of bootstrap. Documented below is the step by step build of the site using Bootstrap.

## Navigation Bar
### The navigation bar was implemented using Bootstrap. Bootstrap was used to add the navigaton bar with built in Menu.

## Jumbotron

### Implemented Hero section using Bootsrapalong with a card added which has a custom built image (Canva). Instead of listing the skills I am expected to learn in the bootcamp I added my current skillset given I have some experience which overlapped.

## Projects/work 

### The display was built using a Bootstrap grid section which displayed cards, images and descriptive text. The project section is internally linked and the Netflix clone links to an external page. 

## About Me 

### The about me section was built at the top of the page using a grid layout in an attempt to mirror the original site.

## Footer 

### The footer was copied and implemented from the original, all links have the hover effect flowing through other elemets of the pageas-well as the footer to keep the style consistant.

## Media Queries

### Bootstrap dramatically reduced the need for media queries as a lot of the elements styled themselves.

## Reseasrch

### MDM, StackOverflow, google and class material were used at various points throughout the build. 

## Live

### Below are screenshots of the final version of the site along which you can find live here ......
